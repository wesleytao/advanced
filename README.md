## Advanced Assignments (AA)

The series of advanced assignments will ask you to write programs or edit a simple database to turn the concepts discussed in class into actual code.  Some of these will be self-contained assignments, and some will add new features or improvements into a simple Python-based query engine called  [DataBass](https://www.github.com/w4111/databass).

You will recieve extra credit equivalent to one homework assignment.  The fifth assignment AA5 is worth slightly more because the assignment is a bit more involved than the others.

* [AA1: Implement OFFSET in DataBass](./databass/offset.md)
* [AA2: Graph analysis using common table expressions](./graph)
* [AA3: Query Compilation](./databass/compile.md)
* [AA4: Fun with Window Functions](./)
* [AA5: Join Optimization](./databass/join.md)
